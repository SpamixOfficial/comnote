# ComNote

Picture this: You and your friend group all have different lists of animes you want to watch or have watched, you have given each entry unique properties (**eg. bold font for recommended by friends**) and all of this is in an Apple Notes document. How the hell are you supposed to share this with your friends...?


**That's where ComNote comes in!**
ComNote is an app to easily share and create your list of animes that you've watched, want to watch or just want to memorize in some way. It also provides features to give your own custom labels to list-items to make sorting and organizing easier.

When you've marked an anime present on your list as watched you can rate it and optionally make this rating public (anonymously or with your account attached). 

After a while though, you are going to run out of animes to watch so you'll naturally want to extend your list; of course ComNote has a solution for this too! When people add animes to their lists and eventually rate them they get a global rating based on all scores wether a rating is public or not (a median value is calculated). This in turn gives it a spot on the global list and its categories' lists. When you go hunting for a new show you just have to check the relevant lists based on what you've watched before!


And all of this, in one app.
